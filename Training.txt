PM looks at the SSMDB and uses the two index levels to create a simple total return for the time period. The DPR is created using FactSet which looks at each individual dayâ€™s return and links them together for the time period. Using this method, FactSet will show a compounding effect and therefore have a slightly different return for the time period. 

We hope that you find this information helpful.
